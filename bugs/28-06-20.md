# oVirt

# Reproducing [Bug 1844822](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1844822)
The main issue is reproducing the bug on "live" environment, without access to the code.
The important part is to have `CommandEntityCleanupManager` run while `CopyImageGroupWithDataCommandParameters` is in the database (`command_entities` table),
so that `CommandEntityCleanupManager` executes `cleanup` and will reload the commands cache from the `command_entities` table. This will fail deserialization
because `destImages` is initialized with `List#of` which makes it an immutable list, which is not serializable by jackson.

To do that we set `CommandEntityCleanupManager` to run at a certain time, can be done with:
```console
/usr/share/ovirt-engine/dbscripts/engine-psql.sh -c "update vdc_options set option_value='18:16:00' where option_name = 'CommandEntityCleanupTime'"
systemctl restart ovirt-engine
```

Then we execute a disk copy about 30 seconds before the time we set.

But how do we know `CommandEntityCleanupManager` actually ran?
We can use byteman!

With this nice script we can load some rules that will trace entries to its methods:
```shell
OEPID=$(pidof ovirt-engine)
OEUSER=$(ps -o user -p ${OEPID} h)


# attach the agent into a running engine. Jboss attaches the agent to
# itself only if the command is run with the user that Jboss is run with
# ('ovirt' by default)
sudo -u $OEUSER bminstall $OEPID


# create a script to print all outgoing vds commands and return values
# it might be required to:
# - create the directory /home/$OEUSER
# - chown -R $OEUSER:$OEUSER /home/$OEUSER
cat << EOF | sudo -u $OEUSER tee /tmp/byteman.btm
RULE trace cleanup manager
CLASS org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.CommandEntityCleanupManager
METHOD cleanup
AT ENTRY
IF true
DO traceln("*** execute cleanup")
ENDRULE

RULE trace something else
CLASS org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.CommandEntityCleanupManager
METHOD init
AT ENTRY
IF true
DO traceln("*** execute cleanup init")
ENDRULE
EOF

# load the script into the running jvm
sudo -u $OEUSER bmsubmit -l /tmp/byteman.btm
```

Prerequisits:
We need to have `byteman` installed and `JAVA_HOME` set and pointing to the location of the JDK so `tools.jar` is accessible.
